Kubernetes is a wonderful technology with massive adoption but the road to production may have some bumps. 

In this session we'll look at how we partnered with the community to make it easier.

Demos and code heavy. 

Speaker Bio

For the last 16 years, Ricardo has one mission - help companies ship better software, faster.

A long time rock and roller, his sessions are usually anything but boring.
